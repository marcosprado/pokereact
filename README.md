# Pokedex Landing Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is Pokedex 2.0. I'm just having fun with React and using it to recreate previous Pokedex project (based on Vanilla JS)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
